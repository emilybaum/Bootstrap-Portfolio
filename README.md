# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This page uses Bootstrap css mostly for styles. There are still some pieces of CSS that are in a seperate style sheet. 

Biggest win of this assignment was figuring out how to use flex boxes to put my footer at the bottom of the page/content when the screen is maximized and when the screen is small. Yay flex boxes!
